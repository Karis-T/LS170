## What to Focus On

#### Be aware of how and why HTTP is evolving

> The modern web is very different from Tim Berners-Lee's original conception of it. An awareness of the history of HTTP, and the changes it has undergone over time, can provide us with more insight into the work-arounds used to deal with some of its limitations. This in turn can better enable us to make informed decisions when building networked applications.

#### Be aware of the functionality that browser APIs can provide

> Like HTTP, the browser has evolved significantly since the early days of the web. Modern browsers provide numerous APIs that provide functionality which HTTP alone cannot. An awareness that these APIs exist and what they offer can help us when developing applications.

#### Be aware that Client-Server isn't the only network paradigm

> Most of the focus of this course is on networking within a Client-Server paradigm. As an architecture it is very prevalent on the web, and it might be easy to think that this is the only architecture available to us. Being aware that other network paradigms exist can be useful when making high-level design decisions about networked applications.

## Summary

- HTTP has changed considerably over the years, and is continuing to change.
- Many of the changes to HTTP are focused on improving performance in response to the ever increasing demands of modern networked applications.
- Latency has a big impact on the performance of networked applications. As developers and software engineers we need to be aware of this impact, and try to mitigate against it through the use of various optimizations.
- In building networked applications, there are tools and techniques available to us that work around or go beyond the limitations of basic HTTP request-response functionality.
- For certain use cases a peer-to-peer architecture may be more appropriate than a client-server architecture.
